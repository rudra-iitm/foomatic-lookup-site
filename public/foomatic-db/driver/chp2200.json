It's\n    based on Uli and Matthew's <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj850\">cdj850</a> and <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj880\">cdj880</a> drivers,\n    with a new front-end to speak the different RGB-encoded PCL flavor\n    used by these printers.<p>\n\n    The original source package is not provided any more on HP's web\n    sites. You can download it here from\n    OpenPrinting. Installation instructions you find in the\n    package.<p>\n\n    The provided source is for gs 6.01; it probably works against\n    anything at all recent. It is also contained in ESP Ghostscript\n    7.07, 8.15, and later and GPL Ghostscript 8.60 and later. So all\n    distributions using these Ghostscript versions and perhaps also\n    others will ship this driver.<p>\n\n    After getting a tip from the driver's author I (Till) succeeded to\n    compile it for GNU Ghostscript 5.50. You must copy the function\n    \"gdev_pcl_mode9compress\" from the gdevcd8.c file of the <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj880\">cdj880</a> driver\n    into the end of the gdevcd8.c of HP's \"chp2200\" driver. Then you\n    follow the instructions in HP's source package and Ghostscript\n    will compile.<p>\n\n    (Former) Maintainer: siow-kiat_tan-at-hp.com.<p>"
