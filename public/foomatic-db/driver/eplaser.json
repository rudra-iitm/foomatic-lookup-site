It does not support the Epson EPL \"L\" series. There\n    you have to use the third-party driver \"<a\n    href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/\">epsonepl</a>\".<p>\n\n    Here some hints for older versions of the driver:<p>\n\n    Version 1.0.4 of this driver works only with Ghostscript 5.50, not\n    with Ghostscript 6.5x and newer.  For the new Ghostscript versions\n    use <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-6.51-Epson_eplaseren.patch\">this\n    patch</a> from Crutcher Dunnavant (Red Hat).<p>\n\n    Version 3.0.2 is prepared for both Ghostscript 5.x and 6.x. For\n    Ghostscript 7.x or newer a small fix is needed: Execute the\n    following command line in the main directory of the unpacked\n    driver source package:<p>\n\n    <tt>perl -p -i -e\n    \"s/GS_VERSION_MAJOR\\s*==\\s*6/GS_VERSION_MAJOR &gt;=\n    6/\" gdevescv.c gdevesmv.c</tt><p>\n\n    Then the driver also compiles with these versions of\n    Ghostscript.<p>"
