So the driver does not need to run SUID\n    root. The access is done via the \"parport_pc\" kernel module and a\n    CUPS backend which comes with the driver. The driver does not work\n    with USB- or network-connected printers.<p>\n\n    The Foomatic PPD file for this driver is not available on\n    OpenPrinting because it is already contained in the driver\n    package.<p>"
