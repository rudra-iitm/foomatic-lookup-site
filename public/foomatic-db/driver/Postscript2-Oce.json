PostScript printers are supported natively\n      in Linux and Unix environments, so you only need the PPD file\n      for your printer, no driver executables, to get access to all\n      printing functionality. The PPD contains all information about\n      properties and user-settable options which are specific to the\n      printer and makes printing dialogs show these options and allow\n      the user to control all the printer's functionality.<p>\n\n      The PPDs only support the printing functionality of the\n      printers. To use extra functionality, like scanning, faxing, ... you\n      will perhaps need additional software.<p>\n\n      Note that these printers work, like all other PostScript\n      printers, with <a\n      href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=Postscript\">generic PostScript\n      PPD files</a>, but then you will not get access to all the\n      printer specific functionality.<p>"
