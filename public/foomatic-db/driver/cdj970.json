HP\n    refused to help; Rene' sensibly suggests that people not buy HP\n    products because of this uncoperative policy.<P>\n\n    Rene's web page, with the instructions, is in German.\n    German-impaired readers can probably follow them anyway; they're\n    step-by-step and show all the commands to build the driver.\n    <p>\n\n    The driver takes the same arguments as the <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj850\" \n >cdj850</a>\n    driver, plus the three described on Rene's website."
