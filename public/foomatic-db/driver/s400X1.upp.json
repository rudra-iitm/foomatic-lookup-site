He has even written some\n      small program for that (downloadable from the driver's web\n      page). He claims that the quality is much better than the\n      quality of Gimp-Print or even Windows. The driver is only tested\n      on plain paper, reports about its quality on other papers and\n      additional optimizations for other papers are welcome.<p>\n\n      UPP files of this driver: s400a1.upp, s400b1.upp<p>"
