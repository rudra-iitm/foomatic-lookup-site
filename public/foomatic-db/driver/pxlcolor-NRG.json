PCL XL printers are supported\n      by Ghostscript's built-in \"pxlcolor\" driver which is available\n      in all Linux and Unix operating systems. So you only need the\n      PPD file for your printer, no extra driver executables, to get\n      access to all printing functionality. The PPD contains all\n      information about properties and user-settable options which are\n      specific to the printer and makes printing dialogs show these\n      options and allow the user to control all the printer's\n      functionality.<p>\n\n      These PPDs are especially made for use on Linux/Unix\n      systems. Especially they support all advanced printer features\n      like Locked Print, Ducument Server, User Code, ... Note that\n      although the printers are PostScript printers these PPD files\n      need foomatic-rip. See the <a\n      href=\"http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/Database/RicohFAQ\">Ricoh\n      FAQs</a> for more details.<p>\n\n      Note that these printers work, like all other PCL XL printers,\n      with <a href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=pxlcolor\">generic PCL\n      XL PPD files</a>, but then you will not get access to all\n      the printer-specific functionality.<p>"
