It must\n    be configured for bidirectional access and it must use the I/O\n    address 0x378. The driver must run SUID \"root\", so the printer is\n    not suitable for security-critical systems. Any output destination\n    specified in the printer spooler will be ignored.<p>\n\n    The Foomatic PPD files for this driver are not available on\n    OpenPrinting because they are already contained in the driver\n    package.<p>"
