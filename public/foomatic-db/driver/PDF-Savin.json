PDF printers are\n      supported natively in Linux and Unix environments (including Chrome OS), so you only\n      need the PPD file for your printer, no driver executables, to\n      get access to all printing functionality. The PPD contains all\n      information about properties and user-settable options which are\n      specific to the printer and makes printing dialogs show these\n      options and allow the user to control all the printer's\n      functionality.<p>\n\n      These PPDs are especially made for use on Linux/Unix\n      systems. Especially they support all advanced printer features\n      like Locked Print, Ducument Server, User Code, ...<p>"
