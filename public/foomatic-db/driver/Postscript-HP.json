These are most\n      DesignJets (large format printers) and one PostScript standard\n      format inkjet (OfficeJet 9100, HPLIP supports it only in PCL\n      mode).<p>\n\n      See the \"<a\n      href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hplip\">hplip</a>\" driver\n      entry for all HP PostScript printers not mentioned\n      here.<p>\n\n      PostScript printers are supported natively in Linux and Unix\n      environments, so you only need the PPD file for your printer, no\n      driver executables, to get access to all printing\n      functionality. The PPD contains all information about properties\n      and user-settable options which are specific to the printer and\n      makes printing dialogs show these options and allow the user to\n      control all the printer's functionality.<p>\n\n      Note that the PPDs are originally developed for the Mac OS X\n      operating system. So they contain entries which are not made use\n      of under Linux.<p>\n\n      The PPDs only support the printing functionality of the\n      printers. To use additional functionality, like ink/toner level\n      check, inkjet head cleaning, scanning, faxing, ... you need\n      <a href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">HPLIP</a> in\n      addition to the PPD files.<p>\n\n      Note that these printers work, like all other PostScript\n      printers, with <a\n      href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=Postscript\">generic PostScript\n      PPD files</a>, but then you will not get access to all the\n      printer specific functionality.<p>"
