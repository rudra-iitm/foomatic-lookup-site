Timur Maximov has posted a patch for introducing this\n    driver into GPL Ghostscript 8.63 on the <a\n    href=\"http://forums.linux-foundation.org/read.php?20,7942,7942#msg-7942\">forums</a>. Patches\n    for both GPL Ghostscript 8.63 and 8.64 are available on the\n    download URL. GPL Ghostscript 8.65 will already contain the\n    driver.<p>\n\n    The new driver will simply use the different page start and end\n    sequences needed by the DesignJet 500 and 800 but otherwise be the\n    same as \"chp2200\".<p>\n\n    The driver can be added to the Ghostscript source of the versions\n    8.63 and 8.64 by applying the appropriate patches. Note that for\n    Ghostscript 8.64 you need to re-run \"./autogen.sh\" after applying\n    the patch. Or get the Ghostscript under development from the\n    Subversion repositories, there the driver is already\n    included.<p>"
