For advanced functionality such\n    as printer status and maintenance features, use the\n    <a href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">\n    HPLIP driver</a> (which includes HPIJS). <p>\n    \n    To get its maximum quality, use the HPLIP driver,\n    since HPIJS 1.2 there is explicit support for this printer. 600\n    dpi in colour is not supported by the hardware.<p>\n\n    David Suffield, developer of HPIJS at HP, said about\n    the HPIJS 1.1 driver:<p>\n\n    <i>HPLIP (set up as for the DeskJet 600 series)\n    works for the Deskjet 850 series, much better than Gimp-Print, but\n    color was not as good as with \"cdj850\". Some people may\n    prefer \"cdj850\" for color, others may prefer\n    HPLIP for the speed.</i><p>\n\n    The \"cdj850\" driver is included with Ghostscript as of\n    Ghostscript version 6.0.<p>\n\n    Works also with the \"pcl3\" driver.<p>\n\n    This is the same printer as the 870Cxi and 870Cse.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: One black and one CMY color cartridge<p>"
