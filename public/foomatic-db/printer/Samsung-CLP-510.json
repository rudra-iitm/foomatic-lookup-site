            "en": "This is a cheap color laser printer with a proprietary\n    language. Samsung provides a closed-source driver on their web\n    site, the \"Unified Linux Driver\", a driver package containing CUPS\n    drivers and PPDs for all Samsung printers. Version 2.00.90 and\n    newer supports also this printer. Output is raster-only, and due\n    to glitches in the software, monochrome sources are output as\n    color (visible flecks of cyan, magenta, and yellow). It is also\n    not easy to install this driver in arbitrary distributions. See\n    the user reports below.<p>\n\n    As the first free software printer driver SpliX supports this\n    printer, but the driver still needs testing. So please try out\n    this printer with SpliX and report your results to the author of\n    the driver.<p>\n\n    <hr>\n\n    User reports:<p>\n\n    I have installed and de-installed the printer a few times using\n    the driver from Samsung (2.0.90).  I am using Ubuntu 6.06.  I have\n    managed to get it to print a test page in KDE and Cups, but it\n    only prints half the page and the bottom is blank.  Before that,\n    it printed a test page that was full of errors about\n    PCL.<p>\n\n    The printer does work with Cups Version &lt; 2 and the\n    provided proprietary drivers. It will print out white pages unless\n    you specify the locale to eg. POSIX (eg. \"LC_ALL=POSIX lpr\n    test.ps\").<p>\n\n    The proprietary driver does just support 600dpi.<p>\n\n    <hr>\n\n    I use Suse 10.1 and I installed the Samsung unified driver\n    2.00.90.  The printer works BUT:\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>no choice for resolution;</li>\n      <li>duplex doesn't work.</li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <hr>\n\n    Overall, it's a cheap color laser printer and a pretty good\n    value, but the lack of support for other operating systems makes\n    it a little less than attractive.  Print quality is decent while\n    lacking options that are supported by the Windows driver, and be\n    prepared for the printer to put up a fight as you try to use it.\n    The driver seems to crash when printing certain things (mostly\n    webpages), and there is no support from Samsung for the driver and\n    no specification of the SPL-C language available.  While I\n    haven't determined the exact reason of the crash, it seems to\n    be due to the custom backend filters the Samsung driver uses.  It\n    very well could be a combination of a broken build of my system\n    (an older build of Gentoo) and using an Athlon64, but the issue\n    seems very similar to the first user's comments.  The output\n    will stop randomly in the middle of a page, and syslog will show a\n    segfault in gs, though recompiling ghostscript doesn't seem\n    to change the issue.<p>\n\n    I wasn't able to reproduce the \"prints black with\n    expensive color toner\" bug mentioned above.  I examined the\n    CUPS test page, printed with the proprietary Linux drivers, and\n    with Acrobat under Windows.  Neither showed flecks of color in or\n    around black areas, but the linux version was clearly 600 dpi,\n    while the windows version was at 1200.  Color matching under linux\n    is wrong; the \"blue\" pie wedge comes out purple.  The\n    drivers ship with *.cms files that look like color profiles, but I\n    don't know how to install them yet.<p>\n\n    Duplex can be set via the printer's front panel and LCD\n    display; the setting via cups doesn't work (although enabling\n    duplex via cups adds a blank page to the end of each odd-length\n    document...). I'm using version 2.00.90 of the drivers, and\n    have seen no stability problems in the ~10 pages I've printed\n    under linux so far.<p>\n\n    Be warned that the samsung driver installer attempts to install\n    older versions of standard c++ libraries into /usr/ without\n    prompting.  According to its documentation, it also replaces lpr\n    with a \"GUI LPR\" that will pop up a dialog when you\n    print.  If you download the samsung drivers, you may prefer to\n    manually install them.  The drivers include binaries for i386 and\n    x86_64.  Put the stuff from the appropriate \"filter\" and\n    \"ppd\" directories into /usr/lib/cups/filter/ and\n    /usr/share/ppd/Samsung, respectively.  (The directories should\n    already exist, and may vary between linux distributions.) Then,\n    install the printer via the CUPS web gui (<a\n    href=\"http://localhost:631/).\">http://localhost:631/).</a>\n    The drivers shoud show up under \"SAMSUNG\".  Apparently,\n    you used to need to create a file called /etc/linuxprint.cfg.  I\n    didn't have to do that.<p>\n\n    Install Samsung CLP-510 color laser printer to Ubunutu dapper\n    i386 &amp; x86_64<br>\n    <tt>sudo adduser cupsys shadow</tt><br>\n\n    Insert in /etc/udev/rules.d/60-symlinks.rules<br>\n\n    <tt># Create symlink for usb printer to /dev/usb/lp*<br>\n    BUS==\"usb\",\n    KERNEL==\"lp[0-9]*\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    SYMLINK+=\"usb/%k\"</tt><br>\n\n    restart udev:<br>\n\n    <tt>/etc/init.d/udev restart<br>\n    /etc/init.d/cupsys restart</tt><br>\n\n    download latest Samsung CLP-510 driver from\n    <a href=\"http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/DR/200607/20060719124812000_UnifiedLinuxDriver.tar.gz\">http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/DR/200607/20060719124812000_UnifiedLinuxDriver.tar.gz</a><br>\n\n    <tt>tar -zxvf 20060719124812000_UnifiedLinuxDriver.tar.gz</tt><br>\n\n    The package will create a folder called cdroot<br> The package\n    offers an automatic setup, but it doen't work for me, I can\n    only print half page, therefore, I uninstalled and create it\n    manually.<br>\n\n    <tt>cd cdroot/Linux</tt><br>\n\n    You'll find 3 folders, i386;noarch&amp;x86_64<br>\n\n    <tt>/cdroot/Linux$ cp noarch/at_root/etc/sane.d/smfp.conf /etc/sane.d/<br>\n    /cdroot/Linux$ cp noarch/at_opt/share/ppd/CLP-510splc.ppd\n    /usr/share/ppd/linuxprinting.org-gs-builtin/</tt><br>\n\n    now we have to go either i386 or x86_64 depends on your distro<br>\n    For x86_64 we choose x86_64 folder<br>\n\n    <tt>/cdroot/Linux$ cp x86_64/at_root/usr/lib64/libmfp.so.1.0.1 /usr/lib64/<br>\n    /cdroot/Linux$ cp x86_64/at_root/usr/lib64/cups/backend/mfp\n    /usr/lib64/cups/backend/<br>\n    /cdroot/Linux$ cp x86_64/at_root/usr/lib64/cups/filter/*\n    /usr/lib64/cups/filter/</tt><br>\n\n    now use CUPS' web interface or your distribution's\n    printer setup tool to add the printer<br> when prompt for\n    userid and passwd use root and root password<br> hope this\n    help<p>\n\n    <hr>\n\n    rpc(at)belug.org adds:<p>\n\n    My distribution is Debian Etch and my installation with the above\n    mentioned \"Unified Driver\" worked.

The PPD - file of version 1.9 (shipped\n    with my printer in 02/2006) is errornous and therefore not\n    useable. Then you have to change the paperformat from Letter to A4\n    ( ;-) ) and switch on duplex within CUPS and then the printer\n    works perfectly. CUPS says it has 600dpi, but whether it has 600\n    or 1200dpi I won't mind: I am too old to see the\n    difference.<p>\n\n    HTH<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: B, C, M, Y, total UKP 240<p>"
