They generally work\n    well and cost little.\n\n    Samsung sort of supports Linux use, with installable Linux/x86\n    cups drivers often in the box, a penguin often on the box, etc.\n\n    This particular model is the same printer as the Lexmark E210.\n    The cartridges have a tab thingy to make them not interchangable,\n    but it is easily adjusted.  The Lexmark cartridges apparently cost\n    more.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: toner<p>"
