            "en": "Same as the 1100 with a copier/scanner. \"ljet4\" yields\n    much better prints than \"lj4dith\", HPIJS gives probably\n    the best results.<p>\n\n    For basic printing functionality use the <a href=\"\n    http://hplipopensource.com/\">HPIJS driver</a>.  For\n    advanced functionality such as printer status, maintenance\n    features, scanning and photo card unload use the <a href=\"\n    http://hplipopensource.com/\">HPLIP driver</a> (which\n    includes HPIJS). <p>\n\n    Stand-alone copying should just work, it does not need the\n    PC.<p>\n\n    Unfortunately, this printer has a little hardware problem: The\n    paper separation pad hardens with the time and the printer pulls\n    in several sheets of paper at once. HP is aware of this and\n    offered a kit to fix this without needing to disassemble the\n    printer for free. Unfortunately, HP discontinued this kit. You can\n    perhaps get these kits from other suppliers online for around 10\n    USD.<p>\n\n    The HP LaserJet 1100 has the same engine as the Canon LBP-320,\n    LBP-320 PRO, and LBP-350, and these have the same hardware\n    problem. It is quite feasible to solve this by gluing a 0.5mm\n    rubber strip over the hardened grey separation pad.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: HP UltraPrecise toner cartridge<p>"
