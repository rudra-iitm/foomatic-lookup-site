For advanced functionality such\n    as printer status and maintenance features, use the\n    <a href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">\n    HPLIP driver</a> (which includes HPIJS). <p>\n    \n    Very inexpensive entry level model.<p>\n\n    Does not understand PCL as most other DeskJets, it uses the\n    so-called \"Lightweight Imaging Device Interface\n    Language\" (LIDIL), these printers are supported by the\n    HPLIP driver beginning from version 1.3. The driver\n    supports resolutions only up to 600 dpi, head alignment settings\n    stored in the printer are not made use of, so use a one-cartridge\n    (CMY) printing mode in case of mis-alignments.<p>\n\n    The printer's top cover has a frame to insert a picture of up\n    to 8.5 x 15.5 inches (HP provides an appropriate paper) to\n    customize it. The HPIJS driver allows printing on this special\n    paper size, so that you can print your printer cover pictures also\n    under free software.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 1 colour (CMY) cartridge and 1 black (K) cartridge<p>"
