The recommended way\n    to test the connection is by checking the ink level with the\n    <tt>escputil</tt> command as follows:<p>\n\n    <tt>escputil -i -u -r /dev/lp0</tt><p>\n\n    where /dev/lp0 should be replaced with the name of your printer\n    port.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Four separately changable cartridges for black and the\n\tcolours<p>"
