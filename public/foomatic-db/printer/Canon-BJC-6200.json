The somewhat coarse looking raster and the light stripe\nartifacts however drop the rating to 'sufficient'\".\n<p>\nThe STP driver printed our test letter too far down on the page. Also\nthe text page was quite dark and with a green tint, but nicely rastered\nand clean text. \"If you do not need grey areas, you may want to use this\ndriver [stp].\n \n...this is about what one would expect; the Canon support in stp is only just beginning."
