Unfortunately, these drivers do not\n    work necessarily with all Linux distributions. You will therefore\n    probably get it more easily working by using standard PCL drivers\n    as \"pxlmono\", \"ljet4\", or \"hpijs-pcl5e\". Also the free software drivers\n    for Samasung's proprietary languages, \"splix\" and \"gdi\"\n    work.<p>\n\n    <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/bugs/70425\">\"pxlmono\"\n    (PCL-6/XL) leads sometimes to problems</a>, therefore we\n    recommend \"splix\" (Sansung's own language) or one of \"hpijs-pcl5e\" or\n    \"ljet4\" (PCL 5e drivers) for this printer.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Toner and drum in one unit<p>"
