            "en": "Sophisticated, but not too expensive 4-ink small-office\n    printer. With 16ppm for black text (economy mode) it is very fast\n    for an inkjet, as fast as modern desktop lasers. Very durable\n    water- and light proof printouts and high printing quality on\n    normal paper due to pigment inks. It is similar to the faster\n    Epson Stylus C80.<p>\n\n    180 nozzles black, 3x60 nozzles for the colours, 3 pl droplets,\n    variable drop size.<p>\n\n    Parallel and USB ports.<p>\n\n    Full support in Gimp-Print 4.1.99b4 or newer.<p>\n\n    Epson only advertises a resolution of 2880x720 for this printer\n    (whicch is currently the maximum resolution with the Windows/MacOS\n    drivers) with Gimp-Print 4.1.99rc1 and newer it does real\n    2880x1440 dpi. For drawings with fine details 1440x1440 dpi is\n    recommended because this makes fine vertical and horizontal lines\n    having equal widths.<p>\n      \n    This printer cannot be tested by sending plain text to it, as the\n    printer may or may not respond to the text.  The recommended way\n    to test the connection is by checking the ink level with the\n    <tt>escputil</tt> command as follows:<p>\n\n    <tt>escputil -i -u -r /dev/lp0</tt><p>\n\n    where /dev/lp0 should be replaced with the name of your printer\n    port.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Four separately changable cartridges for black and the\n\tcolours<p>"
