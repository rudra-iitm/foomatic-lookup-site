            "en": "This printer has slots for CompactFlash, SmartMedia, and Sony\n    Memory Stick photo memory cards. so one can print photos without\n    PC. The front panel has a graphical user interface which gives\n    many options for printing from photo cards. There is also a\n    connector for a little color LCD monitor for choosing the photos\n    to print. Photo download works with kernel 2.4.21 or later. The memory card can be simply mounted as a\n    USB-mass-storage device then.<p>\n\n    6-color CMYKcm printing.<p>\n\n    Roll paper feeder with cutter. Roll paper handling works as with\n    older Epson Stylus Photo models, there are no control options for\n    the cutter in Gimp-Print yet and when one presses the \"Roll Feed\"\n    button on the front panel to eject the printout, it is cut, but\n    near 2 cm after the image, leaving a white border. So for\n    correctly cut photos you have to copy them onto a memory card and\n    then print via the front panel.<p>\n\n    USB only.<p>"
