The front panel has a\n    graphical user interface which gives many options for printing\n    from photo cards. There is also a a little color LCD monitor\n    included for choosing the photos to print. Photo download works\n    with kernel 2.4.21 or later. The memory card can be simply mounted\n    as a USB-mass-storage device then. A USB port in the printer\n    allows also to connect PictBridge-compatible cameras, ZIP or\n    CD-ROM drives for photo printing.<p>\n\n    6-color CMYKcm printing, printing on inkjet-printable CDs and DVDs\n    possible (not yet supported by Gimp-Print).<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 6 separately exchangeable ink cartridges<p>"
