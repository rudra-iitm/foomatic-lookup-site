So even when Ghostscript with the\n    HPLIP driver only renders the image with 300 or 600\n    dpi, the higher resolutions are used for the internal\n    dithering. So if you insert photo paper, the printer will print in\n    photo quality, no paper type choice in the driver's options\n    is needed. There is also a special high resolution mode where the\n    image is rendered in 1200 dpi and interpolated to 4800x1200 dpi by\n    the hardware, without paper detection, intended for photo paper\n    only.<p>\n\n    This printer supports an optional duplex unit (probably supported\n    by the HPLIP, \"cdj970\", and \"pcl3\"\n    drivers).<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Refill: 1 black or photo, 1 color cartridge<p>"
