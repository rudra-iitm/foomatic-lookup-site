            "en": "This is a cheap color laser printer with a proprietary\n    language. Samsung provides a closed-source driver on their web\n    site, the \"Unified Linux Driver\", a driver package containing CUPS\n    drivers and PPDs for all Samsung printers. Version 2.00.90 and\n    newer supports also this printer. Output is raster-only, and due\n    to glitches in the software, monochrome sources are output as\n    color (visible flecks of cyan, magenta, and yellow). It is also\n    not easy to install this driver in arbitrary distributions. See\n    the user reports below in the <a\n    href=\"show_printer.cgi?recnum=Samsung-CLP-510\">entry\n    for the CLP-510</a>.<p>\n\n    As the first free software printer driver SpliX supports this\n    printer, but the driver still needs testing. So please try out\n    this printer with SpliX and report your results to the author of\n    the driver.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: B, C, M, Y, total UKP 240<p>"
