For advanced functionality such\n    as printer status and maintenance features, use the\n    <a href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">\n    HPLIP driver</a> (which includes HPIJS). <p>\n\n    Fast, high-quality printing and copying. Improve office productivity \n    with fast print, copy and scan speeds of up to 55 pages per minute (ppm) \n    and a first-copy-out speed of 3.4 seconds.<p>\n    High-capacity, versatile paper handling. With up to seven paper input \n    sources and an input capacity of up to 6,600 sheets, the MFP supports \n    high-volume printing and copying, minimizes intervention and offers \n    flexibility that will meet the needs of every department user.<p>\n    HP's built-in Electronic Copy Monitor is an easy way to track, report and ultimately \n    optimize your copying costs.<p>"
