If you\n    cannot update to HPIJS 1.3 for some reason, you can also use HPIJS\n    1.2.2 with the patches from Matthias Bunte and Richard\n    Spencer-Smith (\"hpijs-rss\"). The Gimp-Print driver also\n    works (Model setting: \"pcl-900\"), but only up to 600\n    dpi.<p>\n\n    Copying should just work, it does not need the PC.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 2 cartridges<p>"
