Apple's web pages have good information on switch settings, and even a suggested printcap file.  Search for \"LaserWriter AND unix\" in thier Older Hardware section. <p>You will need to build a funny serial cable to turn DSR/DTR handshaking into RTS/CTS.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Toner cartridge, around $60 new, refills okay<p>"
