With\n      the HL-2030 drivers, the text was first shifted too far up on\n      the page; this went away after deleting the printer in YaST2 and\n      adding it again. Works fine now, difference to first user entry:\n      Toner Saving only \"on\" or \"off\", but can\n      select from a list of different paper sizes and media\n      types. Printing two or four pages per sheet works fine from\n      kpdf.<p>\n\n      <b>Another user:</b> On Fedora Core 4, with\n      KDE. hl1250 driver worked for me, except when printing 2 pages\n      on one sheet (margins were wrong). hl2030 driver from brother\n      works perfectly for me.<p>\n\n      <p><b>Another user:</b> Also works fine\n      (multiple pages, toner save etc) on Kubuntu 6.06 with the Debian\n      Brother drivers.

No installation, no anything.\n\n      <p><b>Another user:</b> Works pretty well with\n      Brother's HL-2030 driver.
