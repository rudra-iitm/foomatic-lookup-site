I used the original PPD\n    (supposedly just written to support MacOS and MS Win printing)\n    with CUPS, which used its LPD backend to send the PostScript to\n    the printer. In this way all options of the printer can be\n    used.<p>\n\n    (tested by Kurt Pfeifle)<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: toner<p>"
