The driver\n    supports resolutions only up to 600 dpi, head alignment settings\n    stored in the printer are not made use of, so use a one-cartridge\n    (CMY) printing mode in case of mis-alignments.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 1 colour (CMY) cartridge and optionally 1 black (K)\n        cartridge<p>"
