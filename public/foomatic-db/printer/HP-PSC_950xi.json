To choose photos from your memory card, the machine\n    makes an index sheet with thumbnails of all photos and you can\n    mark which photos you want to print and how they should get\n    printed with a pen on the sheet and then you scan the sheet to\n    execute the printing job.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 2 cartridges<p>"
