            "en": "For basic printing functionality use the <a href=\"\n    http://hplipopensource.com/\">HPIJS driver </a>. \n    For advanced functionality such as printer status, maintenance \n    features, and photo card unload use the <a href=\"\n    http://hplipopensource.com/\">HPLIP driver</a> \n    (which includes HPIJS). <p>  \n\n    HP's first 7-ink printer using three cartridges at once, a\n    standard color (CMY), a black (K), and a photo cartridge (probably\n    cmk). Because the printer's hardware does all dithering internally\n    when HP's HPLIP driver is used, 7-ink printing is\n    fully functional under free operating systems.<p>\n\n    It has ports on the side for inserting SmartMedia, CompactFlash,\n    IBM Microdrive, SD, or Sony Memory Stick digital \"film\" and\n    has a color LCD panel which displays your photos (as a digital\n    camera does) so that you can select pictures to print easily. This\n    way one can use the device as a digital photo lab without\n    PC.<p>\n\n    It has a USB port on its front side to directly connect a digital\n    camera (HP only).<p>\n\n    Border-less (full bleed) printing on paper sizes up to\n    Oufuku-Hagaki is supported with the HPLIP\n    driver.<p>\n\n    Best output quality reachable with the HPLIP driver\n    (printer compatible to HP DeskJet 990C), especially the 1200-dpi\n    high resolution mode gives excellent photo quality.<p>\n\n    When used with HP's HPLIP driver, this printer\n    auto-detects the paper type and ink cartridge type and does\n    appropriate dithering and colour adjustment internally, controlled\n    by the hardware. So even when Ghostscript with the\n    HPLIP driver only renders the image with 300 or 600\n    dpi, the higher resolutions are used for the internal\n    dithering. So if you insert photo paper, the printer will print in\n    photo quality, no paper type choice in the driver's options\n    is needed. There is also a special high resolution mode where the\n    image is rendered in 1200 dpi and interpolated to 4800x1200 dpi by\n    the hardware, without paper detection, intended for photo paper\n    only.<p>\n\n    This printer supports an optional duplex unit (probably supported\n    by the HPLIP, \"cdj970\", and \"pcl3\"\n    drivers).<p>\n\n    When the black and/or the photo cartridge is not installed the\n    printer does not stop working, it switches automatically to a 6-,\n    4-, or even 3-ink process and goes on printing, but slower and in\n    an appropriately lower quality.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Refill: 1 black, 1 photo, 1 color cartridge<p>"
