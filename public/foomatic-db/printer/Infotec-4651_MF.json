All options can be used:\n    select 1 of 5 trays; choose A4, Letter, A3 etc.; duplex printing;\n    safe toner (draft printing); switch back to 400 dpi;inline\n    finishing with stapling and punching (if you've got the\n    Finisher 3000 installed).<p>\n\n    The standard equipment is with PDL support of PCL 5e and PCL 6;\n    you can have PostScript 3 as an option - this\n is what I had at\n    my disposal and what I only used.<p>\n\n    It is doing 65 A4 ppm and is good for 20.000 to 120.000 prints per\n    month. This machine is often to be found in semi-professional\n    environments, large offices etc. with the named printing\n    volume.<p>\n\n    It is an OEM product based on a nearly identical Ricoh device (the\n    Ricoh name of which I'll have to find out first).<p>\n\n    (tested by Kurt Pfeifle)<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: toner<p>"
