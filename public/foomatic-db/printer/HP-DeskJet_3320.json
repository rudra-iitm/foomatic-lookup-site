For advanced functionality such\n    as printer status and maintenance features, use the\n    <a href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">\n    HPLIP driver</a> (which includes HPIJS). <p>\n\n    Super inexpensive printer (49 dollars at HP), comes with only the color\n    (CMY) cartrdge (black cartridge optional), very small cartridges\n    (10 ml black, 8 ml color smaller than the cartridges of the\n    portable DeskJet 450).<p>\n\n    Does not understand PCL as most other DeskJets, it uses the\n    so-called \"Lightweight Imaging Device Interface\n    Language\" (LIDIL), these printers are supported by the\n    HPLIP driver beginning from version 1.3. The driver\n    supports resolutions only up to 600 dpi, head alignment settings\n    stored in the printer are not made use of, so use a one-cartridge\n    (CMY) printing mode in case of mis-alignments.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 1 colour (CMY) cartridge and optionally 1 black (K)\n        cartridge<p>"
