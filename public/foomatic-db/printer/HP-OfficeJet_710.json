Color\n    copying can only be done by software, under free operating systems\n    preferrably with \"<tt>xsane</tt>\". Note that\n    this is very slow due to the necessity of downloading the whole\n    image to the PC and converting it to PostScript and back to a\n    bitmap.<p>\n\n    Faxing from and to the PC is not supported.<p>\n\n    You can clean the printer's nozzles via the front panel\n    menues, but you cannot align the heads this way.<p>\n\n    Older user comment:<p>\n\n    Installs and prints postscript and ascii in b/w or colour under\n    printtool and printerdrake, drivers: most PCL ones,\n    HPLIP from HP is the best choice.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: cartridge, (+refill kit?)<p>"
