I am\n    almost certain that the scanner feature is unsupported. If anyone\n    actually has one, do tell...<p>\n\n    With the stp driver (set up for the BJC-7100 if your Gimp-Print\n    version gives incorrect printouts), it works, although the best\n    modes aren't yet supported. The printouts will come out too\n    dark, so raise the gamma somewhat.<p>\n\n    Canon reported that it probably will work with the driver for the\n    BJC-6200 or BJC-7100. Use it 6-ink photo printing, 4-ink printing is\n    not available for this model.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 6 independent ink tanks<p>"
