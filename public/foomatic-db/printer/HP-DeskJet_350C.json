Not\n    even under Windows.  I had one in our lab for about a month. We\n    sent it back rather than keeping the printer because it looked so\n    bad.  IIRC it only prints at 300 DPI; a driver for the DeskJet\n    500C is the best match...<p>\n\n    (What do you expect? It's a portable printer.)"
