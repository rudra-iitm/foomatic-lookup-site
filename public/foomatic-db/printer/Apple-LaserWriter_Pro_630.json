Contrary to the\n    netatalk HOWTO, comments in this file will screw things up\n    (because of dumb code in LPRng's master filter).<p>\n\n    With CUPS (RedHat 9), install David Mathog's pap backend\n    driver\n    (http://saf.bio.caltech.edu/pub/software/linux_or_unix_tools/pap)\n    into /usr/lib/cups/backend.  Change the paths to pap and psf to\n    \"/usr/bin/pap\" and \"/usr/sbin/psf\" respectively (not\n    /usr/local/(s)bin), and chmod 755 it.  Then use CUPS's\n    web-based config.  Or use RedHat printconf to create a local\n    printer on /dev/null, then edit the DeviceURI in\n    /etc/cups/printers.conf to read \"pap://Laserwriter\".  If you have\n    several Laserwiters, read the real instructions for the pap\n    backend at <a\n    href=\"http://saf.bio.caltech.edu/pub/software/linux_or_unix_tools/pap_backend_with_cups.txt\">http://saf.bio.caltech.edu/pub/software/linux_or_unix_tools/pap_backend_with_cups.txt</a><p>\n\n    Changing the AppleTalk name, setting resolution (300dpi or 600pdi)\n    and enable/disabling test-page-at-power-up needs a Mac (or in my\n    case, an Amiga with ShapeShifter - maybe MOL works, or\n    UAE+Shapeshifter, but I don't know if they support device-level\n    access to the network card) and Apple's printer control software\n    (available from ftp.apple.com).<p>\n\n    Thanks to Duncan Gibb (linuxprinting at duncangibb dot com) for\n    these comments.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Toner units US$50-60, UKP30-40, life about 6000 pages<p>"
