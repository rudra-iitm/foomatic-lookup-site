He started\n    hacking ghostscript, but abandoned it.<p>\n\n    In reality this is the Alps MD-5000. In Europe it is sold by\n    Okidata. I found this information in the README of Julian\n    Bradfield's <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=ppmtocpva\">ppmtocpva</a>\n    driver. Perhaps the printer works also with this driver, but it\n    works with Julian Bradfield's new <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=ppmtomd\">ppmtomd</a>\n    driver.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: several types of ribbon cartridges, black, cyan, magenta, yellow<p>"
