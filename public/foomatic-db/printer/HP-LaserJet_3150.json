            "en": "Multifunction device - copier/scanner/fax/etc.<p>\n\n    PCL 4 emulation appears to be host-based.<p>\n\n    Not usable with free software: an HP tech support person told that\n    half of the 3100's functionality is handled by the\n    Windows-only drivers. Thus, even if you were on a Windows machine\n    and go to the DOS prompt, doing \"DIR &gt; LPT1:\"\n    will fail; everything has to go through the windows\n    drivers. (sigh)<p>\n\n    According to the <a\n    href=\"http://hpoj.sourceforge.net/suplist.shtml\">hpoj\n    project</a>:<p>\n\n    <i>...if you have a LaserJet 3150 connected to an HP\n    JetDirect 70X/170X/300X/500X with firmware x.08.xx or later, you\n    can scan using the JetDirect's embedded web\n    server.</i><p>\n\n    So this is a multifunction device that only scans!<p>\n\n    If you have the luxury of a seperate MS Windows box, you can share\n    the printer in the following manner:<p>\n \n    After installing the normal drivers and JetSuite (HP software),\n    add yet another printer. Use the LPT1: port and HP LasertJet II as\n    the driver, then share this printer. You can now access this share\n    via Linux as an SMB client; use the vanilla \"laserjet\"\n    driver. The PCL emulation will complain, though the printout is\n    fine thus far. You can turn off the complaints by editing your\n    $WINDIR\\JETSUITE.INI and in the \"[PCLEmulation]\"\n    section, set \"DisplayWarning=no\".<p>\n\n    <a\n    href=\"/download/printing/hplj_3100_3150/\">Reverse-engeneering\n    efforts</a> on the printer's protocol have already\n    started, but were not finished. Anyone who makes this device\n    finally working with free software please report on the the HP\n    Forum here on OpenPrinting.<p>\n\n    Unfortunately, this printer has a little hardware problem: The\n    paper separation pad hardens with the time and the printer pulls\n    in several sheets of paper at once. HP is aware of this and offers\n    a kit to fix this without needing to disassemble the printer for\n    free. It can be ordered for delivery into any country via their\n    <a href=\"http://h20015.www2.hp.com/en/document.jhtml?lc=en&docName=bpl08107\">web site</a>.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: cartridge<p>"
