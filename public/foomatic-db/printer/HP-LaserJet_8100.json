Other than sounding like a 737 winding up its turbines, this is one rock solid printer.  This printer also processes jobs quickly, throw your most complex jobs at this one.\n<p>\n[When printing PostScript and used with a combination of the original HP-provided PPD and CUPS you can utilize every single of the above / at 8000 model mentioned options.
