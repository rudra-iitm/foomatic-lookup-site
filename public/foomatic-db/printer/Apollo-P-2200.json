            "en": "Apollo is a brand of HP, the printers use HP cartridges and papers, the\n    main difference is the special design of the printers.<p>\n\n    Comes only with a standard three-colour cartridge and prints black as\n    a mix of the three colours, you get either a black or a photo (black,\n    light cyan, light magenta) cartridge as an option.<p>\n\n    To get its maximum quality, use the HPIJS (\"hpijs-pcl3\")\n    driver. 600 dpi in colour is not supported by the\n    hardware.<p>\n\n    Older comments:</p>\n\n    It is compatible to the <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/pipermail/apollo-list/2001q1/000001.html\">HP\n    DeskJet 612C</a>.</p>\n\n    C't magazine reports:</p>\n\n    Stp was tested, but printed way too dark with a very colorful dot\n    pattern and uneven areas. Stp also has uneven line thicknesses in fonts,\n    but Uniprint is even worse here.</p>\n \n    They had the best results with the \"cdj550\" driver for\n    both text and photos.</p>"
