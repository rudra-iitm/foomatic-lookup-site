In this way all options can be\n    used: select 1 of 6 trays; choose A4, Letter, A3 etc.; use cover,\n    chapter and insert sheets; duplex printing; impose as a booklet;\n    inline finishing with stapling or (in the case of a booklet)\n    folding, saddle-stitching, edge trimming to a finished A4 or A5\n    booklet.<p>\n\n    This is a professional 110 ppm printer for large commercial print\n    shops, originally developed by Kodak; also marketed by DANKA\n    (http://www.danka.de or http://www.danka.com) internationally, who\n    might have even more experience with service and maintenance of\n    this device than Heidelberg who bought its manufacturing and\n    further development off Kodak. This more than 1 million prints per\n    month capable monster prints TIFF, PDF 1.2, PostScript 3, PCL 5;\n    it runs on the output of an Adobe RIP powered by a SUN UltraSparc\n    60.<p>\n\n    (tested by Kurt Pfeifle)<p>"
