Used \nprinttool to set it as an HP LaserJet.\n500k RAM is too little for a PostScript\nimage (using Ghostscript).  Using \na 4Mbyte memory board ($95 board not\nplug in card) Postscript prints great, \nbut slow.  A Postscript option is \navailable for this printer, but the\noption was not used in this evaluation.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: $150 new, $90 refill<p>"
