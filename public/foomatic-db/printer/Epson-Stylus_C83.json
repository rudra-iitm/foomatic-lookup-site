These\n    printers are also capable of full-bleed (borderless)\n    printing.<p>\n\n    Parallel and USB ports.<p>\n\n    With Gimp-Print 4.2.2 or newer it will work (except full-bleed) when\n    choosing the Epson Stylus C82 as printer model, with older Gimp-Print\n    versions when choosing the C80 as printer model.<p>\n\n    This printer cannot be tested by sending plain text to it, as the\n    printer may or may not respond to the text.  The recommended way\n    to test the connection is by checking the ink level with the\n    <tt>escputil</tt> command as follows:<p>\n\n    <tt>escputil -i -u -r /dev/lp0</tt><p>\n\n    where /dev/lp0 should be replaced with the name of your printer\n    port.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Four separately changable cartridges for black and the\n\tcolours<p>"
