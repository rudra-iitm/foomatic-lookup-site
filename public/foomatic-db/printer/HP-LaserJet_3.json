For advanced functionality such\n    as printer status and maintenance features, use the\n    <a href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">\n    HPLIP driver</a> (which includes HPIJS). <p>\n    \n    Make sure you have at least 2MB RAM, otherwise it won't be\n    able to print complex pages.<p>\n\n    Widely available this workhorse just keeps going and going. It\n    also uses about the cheapest toner available. Remanufactured toner\n    is about $25, and Xerox sells new units for about $50. Cheaper to\n    run than ANY inkjet. Keep your eyes open for used HP LJIII or\n    IIID's they are a good buy.<p>\n\n    Warning !!!<p>\n\n    If you have only 1MB of printer RAM: This printer supports 300dpi\n    only under text mode.  If you try to print graphic pages with this\n    resolution, only 3/4 of the page will get printed and you'll\n    get MEM OVERFLOW.  For a full page in graphics mode, you have to\n    set the resolution to 150x150dpi...<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Toner, ~$50<p>"
