It\n    is just a frustrating experience. He returned the printer to the\n    store, after the Samsung technical support told on the phone that\n    they do not support Linux anyway.<p>\n\n    The user H.Samm reported that his printer worked out of the\n    box... so far his experience has been a very good one.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: cartridge CA$ 90<p>"
