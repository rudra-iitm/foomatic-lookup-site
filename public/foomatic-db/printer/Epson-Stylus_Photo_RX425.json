The front panel has a graphical user interface\n    which gives many options for printing from photo cards. Photo\n    download works with kernel 2.4.21 or later. The memory card can be\n    simply mounted as a USB-mass-storage device then. You can also\n    scan documents or photos onto a memory card, for example for usage\n    with a PDA.<p>\n\n    6-color CMYKcm printing, printing on inkjet-printable CDs and\n    DVDs.<p>\n\n    Scanning should work with <a\n    href=\"http://www.sane-project.org/\">SANE</a> using\n    Epson's <a\n    href=\"http://www.avasys.jp/english/linux_e/dl_scan.html\">IScan</a>\n    or perhaps also with SANE's \"<tt>epson</tt>\"\n    backend.<p>\n\n    Copying should just work with the front panel of the\n    device.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 6 separately exchangeable ink cartridges<p>"
