If red comes \nout as brown, you may need to swap the Cyan and Magenta lines \nin the stc800p.upp file, for example, and even then the colors \nwill be sort fo dark. Ghostscript's dithering is also \nnot very good.\n<br>\nThe good news is the Gimp-derived ghostscript driver \"stp\" is really\ngood, so use it; it works perfectly with stp.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: seperate black and color ink cartridges<p>"
