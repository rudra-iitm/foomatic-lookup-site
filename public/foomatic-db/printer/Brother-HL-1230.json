According to the\n    printout quality it is based on the \"ljet4\" Ghostscript\n    driver. \"pxlmono\", \"gimp-print\" (600 dpi), and \"hpijs-pcl5e\" (600 dpi)\n    give a better grayscale quality and all special features of the\n    printer are accessible by PJL commands.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Toner cartridge<p>"
