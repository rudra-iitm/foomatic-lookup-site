Here is his original report:<p>\n\n    <i>\n\n    At first tried with \"pcl3\", but it didn't work ok, appearing white\n    bands between head passes. Then, I contacted the \"pcl3\" developer,\n    Martin Lottermoser, whether it could be a bug in the\n    driver.<p>\n\n    Of course it wasn't a bug in the driver but is a bug in the\n    firmware.<p>\n \n    Anyway, he suggested me to try the \"chp2200\" driver, which i use\n    succesfully.<p>\n\n    The printer works very well, at 300x300 dpi and 600x600 dpi, full\n    colors.<p>\n \n    If you purchase it new, (as I did) check the quality of the black\n    printhead. Mine was faulty, and HP has sent a replacement. To a\n    friend of mine the same happened.<p>\n\n    </i><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: CMYK cartridges and printheads<p>\n\n          Cartridges (CMYK): c4836a c4837a c4838a c4840a<p>\n\n          Print heads (CMYK): c4811a c4812a c4813a c4810a<p><p>"
