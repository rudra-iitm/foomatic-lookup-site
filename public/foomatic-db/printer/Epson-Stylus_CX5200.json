See <a\n    href=\"http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/2571/2002/10/0/9767006/\">this\n    posting on the linux-usb-devel mailing list</a> and the\n    thread \"<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/pipermail/epson-list/2002q4/thread.html\">Epson\n    Stylus cx3200 MFP</a>\" on the <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/epson-list\">Epson\n    Forum</a>.<p>\n\n    You have to remove the following from the\n    <tt>drivers/usb/scanner.c</tt> file in the kernel \n    source:<p>\n\n    <tt>\n    if (dev-&gt;config[0].bNumInterfaces != 1) {<br>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;info(\"probe_scanner: Only one device interface is supported.\");<br>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return NULL;<br>\n    }<p>\n    </tt>\n\n    Then you have to recompile, install, and reload the\n    \"<tt>scanner.o</tt>\" kernel module (the commands have\n    to be executed as \"root\", we assume that the kernel source code is\n    in the <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt> directory):<p>\n\n    <tt>\n    cd /usr/src/linux<br> \n    make modules<br>\n    cp drivers/usb/scanner.o /lib/modules/&lt;Linux version&gt;/kernel/drivers/usb/<br>\n    rmmod scanner<br>\n    modprobe scanner vendor=0x04b8 product=0x0801<p>\n    </tt>\n\n    After having done so you can configure <a\n    href=\"http://www.sane-project.org/\">SANE</a> to use the\n    CX5200 with the \"<tt>epson</tt>\" scanner driver, it is\n    probably compatible to the Epson Perfection 1200U.<p>\n\n    Copying should just work with the front panel of the\n    device.<p>"
