For advanced functionality such\n    as printer status and maintenance features, use the\n    <a href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">\n    HPLIP driver</a> (which includes HPIJS). <p>\n\n    According to David Suffield, HPIJS developer at HP, one gets the\n    best results with the HPLIP driver. Even that the\n    normal color mode does only 300 dpi, it gives a better quality\n    than the 600-dpi \"Presentation\" mode of the\n    \"cdj890\" driver.<p>\n\n    Good quality is also produced by Gimp-Print and the printer will\n    probably work reasonably well with other \"cdjXXX\"\n    drivers and the \"pcl3\" driver.<p>\n\n    Minor color variations from Windows driver.<p>\n\n    The \"cdj890\" driver is included with Ghostscript as of\n    Ghostscript version 6.0.<p>\n\n    Printhead alignment is not supported.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Black=51645, Color=C1823A<p>"
