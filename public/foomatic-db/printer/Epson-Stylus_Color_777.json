The \nnewer versions of gimp-print/stp include explicit support for this, or just \npretend that you have a 680.\n<p>\nThe recent CVS gimp-print does include explicit 777 support, and it works quite well.  Resolution from 360dpi to 2880x720dpi are supported, and while the higher resolutions are quite slow, the printer produces very good output at 2880x720dpi.  The 777 is not listed as a supported printer on the gimp-print page, so the CVS version is probably needed for explicit 777 support.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Seperate Color & Black cartridges, ~$30 a piece<p>"
