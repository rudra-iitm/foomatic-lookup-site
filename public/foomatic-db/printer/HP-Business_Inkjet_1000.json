For advanced functionality such as printer status and maintenance features, use the <a href=\"http://hplip.sf.net/\">HPLIP driver</a> (which includes HPIJS). <p>\n\t        \n    Inexpensive to own and operate with four individual ink cartridges.<p>\n\n    Fast print speeds - Up tp 23ppm black/ 20ppm color.<p>\n\n    Print laser-quality black text and images at up to 4800 optimized dpi color on premium photo paper.<p>\n\n    Best output quality reachable with the HPLIP\n    driver.<p>\n    \n    When used with HP's HPLIP driver, this printer\n    auto-detects the paper type and does appropriate dithering and\n    colour adjustment internally, controlled by the hardware. So even\n    when Ghostscript with the HPLIP driver only renders\n    the image with 300 or 600 dpi, the 2400x1200 dpi are used for the\n    internal dithering. So if you insert photo paper, the printer will\n    print in its highest quality, no paper type choice in the\n    driver's options is needed. There is also a special high\n    resolution mode where the image is rendered in 4800 dpi, without\n    paper detection, intended for photo paper only.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Color(CMY), Black<p>"
