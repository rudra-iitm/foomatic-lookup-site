In addition a Windows toy program to\n    design the hair of \"Barbie\" dolls comes with the\n    printer.<p>\n\n    This printer probably works best with one of the various deskjet\n    drivers; try all the \"cdj...\" ones,\n    \"gimp-print\"/\"stp\",\n    \"pcl3\"/\"hpdj\", etc.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Two HP cartridges<p>"
