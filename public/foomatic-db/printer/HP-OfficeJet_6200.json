The\n    integrated flatbed scanner has an automatic document feeder and is\n    A4/Letter-sized.<p>\n\n    The best printout quality you will get with the HPLIP\n    driver, provided by <a\n    href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">HP</a>\n    (compatible to the HP DeskJet 990C), especially the 1200-dpi high\n    resolution mode gives excellent photo quality (the rendered bitmap\n    is 1200x1200 dpi, but the printer hardware does an interpolation\n    then and prints with the printer's highest resolution). Also\n    the Gimp-Print driver is reported to work (Model setting:\n    \"pcl-900\").<p>\n\n    When used with HP's HPLIP driver, this printer\n    auto-detects the paper type and ink cartridge type and does\n    appropriate dithering and colour adjustment internally, controlled\n    by the hardware. So when Ghostscript with the HPLIP\n    driver only renders the image with 300 or 600 dpi, higher\n    resolutions are used for the internal dithering. So if you insert\n    photo paper, the printer will print in photo quality, no paper\n    type choice in the driver's options is needed. There is also\n    a special high resolution mode where the image is rendered in 1200\n    dpi and interpolated to 4800x1200 dpi by the hardware, without\n    paper detection, intended for photo paper only.<p>\n\n    Border-less (full bleed) printing on paper sizes up to\n    Oufuku-Hagaki is supported with the HPLIP\n    driver.<p>\n\n    To get all functionality of this printer working under Linux,\n    especially also the non-printing features, like scanning, printer\n    status, maintenance, and photo download from memory cards, use the\n    <a href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hplip\">HPLIP\n    driver package from HP</a>.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: One Color(CMY) + one Black(K) or Photo (cmK)<p>"
