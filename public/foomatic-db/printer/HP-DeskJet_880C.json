For advanced functionality such\n    as printer status and maintenance features, use the\n    <a href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">\n    HPLIP driver</a> (which includes HPIJS). <p>\n\n\n    Older comments:<p>\n\n    There is now a driver specifically for this printer; after a bit\n    more tuning this printer will qualify for working\n    \"perfectly\".<p>\n\n    With the cdj880 driver, it works well, but the colors are slightly\n    light overall. It needs to be corrected with -dGammaValC,\n    -dGammaValM, -dGammaValY -dGammaValK and result can be nicely\n    improved.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Dual cartridge:1 B + 1 CMY<p>"
