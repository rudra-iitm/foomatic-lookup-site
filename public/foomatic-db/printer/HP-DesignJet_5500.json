But be careful, the\n    DesignJet 120 uses a different Windows driver.<p>\n\n    There are also drivers for HP's RTL language under\n    developement in both the CUPS/CUPSDDK 1.2 and Gutenprint\n    projects.<p>\n\n    You can also send HP-GL/2 drawings and JPEG images directly to the\n    printer.<p>\n\n    There is also a more expensive PostScript version which is\n    probably the better choice for use with free software.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 6 cartridges (CMYcmK)<p>"
