The\n    driver works only for a parallel port connection, not for\n    USB.<p>\n\n    Note that the proprietary parallel port data transfer protocol is\n    non-standard and not very reliable. So use a cable as short as\n    possible to use this printer. The parallel port must be set to\n    bi-directional in the BIOS (should be already set on modern\n    PCs).<p>\n\n    If there is a PCL emulation, it is done by the Windows\n    driver.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: EP22 cartridge / 2500 pages per cartridge.(A4letter @ 5%)<p>"
