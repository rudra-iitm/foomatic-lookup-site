Like the 8000 and 8100, this\n    mopier handles up to A3 and Ledger size media. Now if you could\n    only fax from it...  It appears to send scans via email, which\n    would work with Linux. [See also, what I've added in\n    relation to LaserJets 8000/8100. This is also true for the Mopier\n    240. Kurt Pfeifle]<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Cartridge<p>"
