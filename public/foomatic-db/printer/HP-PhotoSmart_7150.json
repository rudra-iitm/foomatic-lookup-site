There are no card readers as in older\n    PhotoSmarts.<p>\n\n    Full-Bleed printing supported with HPLIP.<p>\n\n    Best output quality reachable with the HPLIP driver\n    (printer compatible to HP DeskJet 990C), especially the 1200-dpi\n    high resolution mode gives excellent photo quality.<p>\n\n    To get all functionality of this printer working under Linux,\n    especially also the non-printing features, like scanning, printer\n    status, maintenance, and photo download from memory cards, use the\n    <a href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hplip\">HPLIP\n    driver package from HP</a>.<p>\n\n    When used with HP's HPLIP driver, this printer\n    auto-detects the paper type and ink cartridge type and does\n    appropriate dithering and colour adjustment internally, controlled\n    by the hardware. So even when Ghostscript with the\n    HPLIP driver only renders the image with 300 or 600\n    dpi, the higher resolutions are used for the internal\n    dithering. So if you insert photo paper, the printer will print in\n    photo quality, no paper type choice in the driver's options\n    is needed. There is also a special high resolution mode where the\n    image is rendered in 1200 dpi and interpolated to 4800x1200 dpi by\n    the hardware, without paper detection, intended for photo paper\n    only.<p>\n\n    This printer supports an optional duplex unit (probably supported\n    by the HPLIP, \"cdj970\", and \"pcl3\"\n    drivers).<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Refill: 1 black or photo, 1 color cartridge<p>"
