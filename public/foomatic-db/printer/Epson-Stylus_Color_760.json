This means D4 mode is off.\n  Press the Load/Eject button and you're done.\n <p>\nI used the <a href=\"http://lcewww.et.tudelft.nl/~haver/linux/epson.html\">epson740 upp ghostscript driver</a>, and wrote a <a href=\"http://csl.cse.ucsc.edu/~ben/magicfilter/stylus760-filter\">quick magicfilter config (stylus760-filter), available here</a> to use that driver. Then I plopped it into /etc/magicfilter, ran /usr/sbin/magicfilterconfig, and chose the stylus760 filter.\n<p>Everything works except I couldn't figure out how to convince magicfilter to add an EOF character after every print-job, so the pages are not ejected by themselves. Sorry :) Hopefully someone else can figure this out.\n\nI've added another magicfilter, that I have written, it fixes the eject bug at the cost of removing recode support, <a href=\"http://c-cc.co.uk/hosted/epson_760/stylus760-filter\">download it</a>\n<p>------------\n<p>Actually it works great for me even with D4 mode in auto mode (the default).\n<p>\nEd: Probably works best with the stp driver.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: cartridge<p>"
