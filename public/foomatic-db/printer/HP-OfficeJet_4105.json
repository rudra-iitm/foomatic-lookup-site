Printer/scanner/copier/fax.<p>\n\n    To get all functionality of this printer working under Linux,\n    especially also the non-printing features, like scanning, printer\n    status, maintenance, and photo download from memory cards, use the\n    <a href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hplip\">HPLIP\n    driver package from HP</a>.<p>\n\n    As the OfficeJet 4110 series, but somewhat slower printing\n    engine.<p>\n\n    The difference between the 4105 and 4105z models is the\n    size of the memory for received fax pages and for speed\n    dials. Printing, scanning, and copying performance is exactly the\n    same on all variations.<p>\n\n    Does not understand PCL as most other DeskJets/PSCs/OfficeJets, it\n    uses the so-called \"Lightweight Imaging Device Interface\n    Language\" (LIDIL), these printers are supported by the\n    HPLIP driver beginning from version 1.3. The driver\n    supports resolutions only up to 600 dpi, head alignment settings\n    stored in the printer are not made use of, so use a one-cartridge\n    (CMY) printing mode in case of mis-alignments.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 1 colour (CMY) cartridge and 1 black (K) cartridge<p>"
