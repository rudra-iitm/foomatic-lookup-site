Much faster\n    on bitmap graphics. In general, very fast with all\n    documents.<p>\n\n    Brother provides a <a\n    href=\"http://solutions.brother.com/linux/\">driver</a>,\n    too, but binary-only and only for LPD/LPRng. According to the\n    printout quality it is based on the \"ljet4\" Ghostscript\n    driver. \"pxlmono\", \"gimp-print\" (600 dpi), and \"hpijs-pcl5e\" (600 dpi)\n    give a better grayscale quality and all special features of the\n    printer are accessible by PJL commands.<p>\n\n    There is no manual in the box, you find it as PDF file on the CD\n    with the Windows/Mac drivers.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Separate Toner and Drum<p>"
