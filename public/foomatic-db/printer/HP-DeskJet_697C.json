Send all non-ps\n    documents through a2ps, and then everything out through\n    Ghostscript. Still need to setup color printcap entries (I\n    haven't had a need yet) but I don't foresee any problems\n    with this.<p>\n\n    Hardware only does 600x300 in color.<p>\n\n    So this printer should work with some or all of the\n    \"cdj670\", \"cdj550\", or\n    \"pcl3\"/\"hpdj\" drivers. The very finest\n    printing modes are probably not supported, nor is head\n    alignment.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: HP51649A (color); HP51629A (black)<p>"
