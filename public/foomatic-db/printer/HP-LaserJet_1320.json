For advanced functionality such as printer status\n    and maintenance features, use the <a\n    href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\"> HPLIP driver</a>\n    (which includes HPIJS).<p>\n\n    The PostScript mode is very fast for pure text, and very slow on\n    images unless your printer has been upgraded with extra memory.\n    It allows the maximum resolution of 1200x1200 DPI to be used,\n    which makes it the best driver for workloads that require high\n    image quality.<p>\n\n    HPIJS is very fast for text and image printing, but it is limited\n    to 600x600 DPI resolution, which is not the device's maximum\n    capability.  It is the recommended driver for this printer as it\n    has the best performance across all workloads.<p>\n\n    Please try also \"pxlmono\". It is somewhat faster than\n    PostScript when only the default amount of memory is\n    available.<p><p>\n\n    Note that the printer also easily runs out of memory when printing\n    images in 1200x1200 dpi. Reduce the resolution to 600x600 dpi to\n    get faster and more reliable printing.<p>"
