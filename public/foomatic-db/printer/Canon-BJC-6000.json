See the More Info link for BJC-6000 upp \nfiles.\n<br>Currently prints in color at 360dpi or 720dpi on plain paper.\n<br>Colors are slightly imperfect but improving.  \n<br>Support for interesting papers (glossy, photo, transparency, etc) is not \navailable, although the driver author has some ideas.\n<br>Andy Thaller also provides a utility program to contorl alignment, \ncleaning, etc.\n<br>The gimp-print-driver supports this model much better than the solutions \nabove. Additionaly, using the CUPS-drivers supplied with the gimp-print-plugin, \nalmost perfect color output can be produced. Small limitations with 6-color \nprinting lead me to choose status \"Mostly\" for this model.\n<br>NB: the gimp-print-plugin also supports many other Canon BJC models - \nconsult the homepage for a complete list.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: cartridge<p>"
