Some people may\n    prefer \"cdj850\" for color, others may prefer\n    HPLIP for the speed.</i><p>\n\n    Works also with the cdj850 driver (recommended by the\n    \"hpoj\" team before there was HPIJS support) and also\n    with the cdj550 (and probably other) color deskjet\n    drivers.<p>\n\n    The \"cdj850\" driver is included with Ghostscript as of\n    Ghostscript version 6.0.<p>\n\n    Printhead alignment supported by the front panel menues.<p>"
