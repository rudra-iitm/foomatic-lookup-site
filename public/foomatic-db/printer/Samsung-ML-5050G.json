Tweeking\nthis takes more than just tunelp.)\n[ Ed: One fellow swears that it works, and two fellows can't get it going for the life of them.  Samsung appears to have sold exactly three of these; there are no reports on Usenet etc.  Caveat emptor! ]\n(Ad: the original fellow did not actualy use the pinter, He's a former Samsung employee who thought the printer was an OEM HP3 Laser.)\n ***This printer has Windows-Only PCL \n\"emulation\" in the Windows driver. No hardware PCL support at all.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: ML+5000/XAR (from tigerdirect.com)<p>"
