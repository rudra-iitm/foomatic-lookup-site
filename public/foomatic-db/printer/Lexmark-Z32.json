            "en": "Prints with the lxm3200 driver in all resolutions, but only in\n    bidirectional mode, colours off (I think it is a Ghostscript\n    problem), 300 dpi too light, 600 too dark, 1200 flooded with\n    ink.<p>\n\n    This printer is really slow and somewhat flimsy. It is capable of\n    fairly good output, though.<p>\n\n    <a href=\"http://www.lexmark.com\">Lexmark</a>\n    provides a Linux/x86 binary-only driver for this printer.  <a\n    href=\"http://www.picante.com/~gtaylor/\">I</a>\n    have this printer and a beta of the driver; the combo works fairly\n    well. But don't buy the thing because of this; buy a printer\n    that works with proper free software.<p>\n\n    To obtain the driver simply follow the \"Drivers\" link on\n    the home page. Lexmark's driver does not work with Debian\n    Woody using alien, and it indeed isn't listed as\n    supported.<p>\n\n    <pre>\n    galaxie:~# lexmarkz32\n    lexmarkz32: Symbol `__ti7VDKForm' has different size in shared object, consider re-linking\n    lexmarkz32: error while loading shared libraries: lexmarkz32: undefined symbol: __7VDKFormP14VDKApplicationPci13GtkWindowType\n    </pre>\n    <p>\n\n    ...bummer. It works against Debian potato and Helix Gnome; that\n    library error probably stems from a mismatch between the expected\n    Gtk library (the gui is built using vdk, a c++ wrapper thing, I\n    guess) and whatever you've got. I would expect the z32 binary\n    to still work. Then you can print with all spoolers using the\n    Lexmark Foomatic Kit mentioned below.<p>\n\n    The drivers issued by Lexmark do not contain any CUPS or PDQ\n    configuration file, so use them either with LPD or with my <a\n    href=\"download/printing/lexmark-foomatic-kit.tar.gz\">Lexmark\n    Foomatic Kit</a>. Download it, uncompress it, and follow the\n    instructions of its README file. Due to having access to all\n    options of the driver it leads even to a better printout quality\n    than the Lexmark driver with its original configuration\n    software.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Color, Black (or Photo instead of Black) Separate. $28.91@inkfar<p>"
