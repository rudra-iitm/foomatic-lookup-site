There exists a windows config utility so you need to\n    switch to windows if you wanna reconfig the printer. Toner is a\n    bit expensive but the printer itself was very cheap. There exists\n    a Postscript Level 2 Hardware Upgrade for this printer if you\n    don't want to fiddle with ghostscript. RAM is upgradeable\n    from initial 4MB to 36MB.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Toner (6000pages = 1900 ATS)<p>"
