(Addition by tpo2:)\nThe printer doesn't really work without mem-extension here.\nIt does print out -some- pages, but not f.ex. pages with\n(small) images in it, multiple pages on on sheet (mpage -2)\netc., even with 150dpi. (anybody with mem-extensions to give\naway can contact me at tpo2@spin.ch)<p>\n\n    Brother publishes proprietary Linux drivers for CUPS and LPD for\n    most of their laser printers and multi-function devices, including\n    SANE drivers for the scanners. They can be downloaded free of\n    charge on their <a\n    href=\"http://solutions.brother.com/linux/en_us/\">Linux driver\n    page</a>.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: toner (same as LaserJet II)<p>"
