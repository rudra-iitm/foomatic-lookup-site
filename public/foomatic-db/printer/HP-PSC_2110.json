Also\n    the Gimp-Print driver is reported to work (Model setting:\n    \"pcl-900\").<p>\n\n    When used with HP's HPLIP driver, this printer\n    auto-detects the ink cartridge type and does appropriate dithering\n    and colour adjustment internally, controlled by the hardware. Note\n    that in contrary to most other newer HP inkjets the paper type has\n    to be adjusted on the front panel, there is no paper type\n    sensor. So when Ghostscript with the HPLIP driver only\n    renders the image with 300 or 600 dpi, higher resolutions are used\n    for the internal dithering. There is also a special high\n    resolution mode where the image is rendered in 1200 dpi and\n    interpolated to 4800x1200 dpi by the hardware, intended for photo\n    paper.<p>\n\n    Border-less (full bleed) printing on paper sizes up to\n    Oufuku-Hagaki is supported with the HPLIP\n    driver.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: One Color(CMY) + one Black(K) or Photo (cmK)<p>"
