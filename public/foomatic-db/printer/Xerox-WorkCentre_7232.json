Windows driver does not work when distributed by point and print over a samba server!!!!! (Looks like it needs bidirectional communication?)\nThis is the first xerox machine that i have that can be set up to use ntp to set the clock. It's web interface is poor, you can't access all configurations. PostScript is OPTIONAL ($). We tested only with ethernet, large paper bin and PostScript option installed. We use email to send pdf, and use a mail2fax gateway to send faxes from the machine. PDF compression uses JBIG2 by default, which cannot be processed with current ghostscript properly (6.81). \n      \n      Throughput = 26\n      \n      Foomatic entry made by PPDtoXML T/G 0.18 on 2008-05-25<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 4 cartridges<p>"
