His\n    driver needs testing; give it a shot and give Daniel some\n    feedback. Use the 0.4.1 version (lxm3200). It supports all\n    resolutions, all printing modes, head alignment, and more. If your\n    distro has the old version compiled into Ghostscript and you do\n    not like to recompile Ghostscript with the current one, the\n    foomatic data for the old version is still available (lxm3200m,\n    lxm3200c, and lxm3200p).<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 1 color & 1 black or \"photo\" cartridge $40<p>"
