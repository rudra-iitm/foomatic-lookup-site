            "en": "Portable printer, currently the best portable on the market. The\n    \"ci\" model comes without and the \"cbi\" with\n    rechargeable battery.<p>\n\n    For basic printing functionality use the <a \n    href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">HPIJS \n    driver </a>. For advanced functionality such\n    as printer status and maintenance features, use the\n    <a href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">\n    HPLIP driver</a> (which includes HPIJS). <p>\n\n    Connection via parallel port, USB, and fast infrared. Bluetooth\n    optional<p>\n\n    The printer has a reader for Compact Flash memory cards, but no\n    facility to choose the images to be printed. One needs a camera\n    with DPOF (Digital Print Order Format) for PC-less photo\n    printing.<p>\n\n    The best printout quality you will get with the HPLIP\n    driver, provided by <a\n    href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">HP</a>\n    (compatible to the HP DeskJet 990C), especially the 1200-dpi high\n    resolution mode gives excellent photo quality (the rendered bitmap\n    is 1200x1200 dpi, but the printer hardware does an interpolation\n    then and prints with the printer's highest resolution). Also\n    the Gimp-Print driver is reported to work (Model setting:\n    \"pcl-900\").<p>\n\n    When used with HP's HPLIP driver, this printer\n    auto-detects the ink cartridge type and does\n    appropriate dithering and colour adjustment internally, controlled\n    by the hardware. So when Ghostscript with the HPLIP\n    driver only renders the image with 300 or 600 dpi, higher\n    resolutions are used for the internal dithering. So if you insert\n    a photo cartridge, the printer automatically switches to the 6-ink\n    process.<p>\n\n    Note that in contrary to most other current HP inkjet printers\n    there is no paper type sensor in the printer. You have to choose\n    one of the photo modes manually when using photo paper. There are\n    photo modes with 300 and 600 dpi and a special high resolution\n    photo mode where the image is rendered in 1200 dpi and\n    interpolated to 4800x1200 dpi by the hardware.<p>\n\n    There is also no full-bleed mode as the other printers of the same\n    generation (DeskJet 555x, OfficeJet 61xx, PSC 2xxx, PhotoSmart\n    7xxx) have, but the unprintable margins are smaller when using the\n    photo/card/envelope feeder.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: One Color(CMY) and/or one Black(K) or Photo (cmK)<p>"
