            "en": "It has ports on the side for inserting SmartMedia and CompactFlash\n    digital \"film\" and has an LCD panel that lets you select\n    pictures from the \"film\" to print, so one can use the\n    device as a digital photo lab without PC.<p>\n\n    To get all functionality of this printer working under Linux,\n    especially also the non-printing features, like scanning, printer\n    status, maintenance, and photo download from memory cards, use the\n    <a href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hplip\">HPLIP\n    driver package from HP</a>.<p>\n\n    Best output quality reachable with the HPLIP\n    driver, especially the 1200-dpi high resolution mode gives\n    excellent photo quality.<p>\n\n    When used with HP's HPLIP driver, this printer\n    auto-detects the paper type and does appropriate dithering and\n    colour adjustment internally, controlled by the hardware. So even\n    when Ghostscript with the HPLIP driver only renders\n    the image with 300 or 600 dpi, the 2400x1200 dpi are used for the\n    internal dithering. So if you insert photo paper, the printer will\n    print in its highest quality, no paper type choice in the\n    driver's options is needed. There is also a special high\n    resolution mode where the image is rendered in 1200 dpi, without\n    paper detection, intended for photo paper only.<p>\n\n    In addition to the PhotoSmart P1215 this printer has a duplex unit\n    (supported by the HPLIP, \"cdj970\", and\n    \"pcl3\" drivers).<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Refill: 1 black, 1 color cartridge<p>"
