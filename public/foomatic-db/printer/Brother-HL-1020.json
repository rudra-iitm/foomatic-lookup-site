This\n    happens only for printing in the default resolution of 300\n    dpi. Make sure that Ghostscript prints with 600 dpi (option\n    \"-r600\").\n   <p>\n\n    Brother publishes proprietary Linux drivers for CUPS and LPD for\n    most of their laser printers and multi-function devices, including\n    SANE drivers for the scanners.
