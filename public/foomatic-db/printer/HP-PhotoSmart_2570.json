So even\n    when Ghostscript with the HPLIP driver only renders\n    the image with 300 or 600 dpi, the 2400x1200 dpi are used for the\n    internal dithering. So if you insert photo paper, the printer will\n    print in its highest quality, no paper type choice in the\n    driver's options is needed. There is also a special high\n    resolution mode where the image is rendered in 1200 dpi, without\n    paper detection, intended for photo paper only.<p>\n\n    In addition to the PhotoSmart P1215 this printer has a duplex unit\n    (supported by the HPLIP, \"cdj970\", and\n    \"pcl3\" drivers).<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Refill: 1 black, 1 color cartridge<p>"
