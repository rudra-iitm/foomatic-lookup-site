The installation is quick and flawlessly. You can use CUPS or LPRng as backend. The installer also offers to install a printer management GUI and to integrate that with KDE/Gnome. (This GUI seems to be able to manage other CUPS printers, too; I didn't try that, however.)<p>\n\nThe driver package also contains a set of .ppd files among which is one for the ML-1610, appearently for PS Level 3.<p>\n\nAs the installation went smooth and the printer works fine, I'm setting the status to \"Perfectly\".<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Single toner cartridge / 2,000 pages (ships with 1,000-page starter toner cartridge)<p>"
