Printer/scanner/copier.<p>\n\n    Does not understand PCL as most other DeskJets/PSCs/OfficeJets, it\n    uses the so-called \"Lightweight Imaging Device Interface\n    Language\" (LIDIL), these printers are supported by the\n    HPLIP driver beginning from version 1.3. The driver\n    supports resolutions only up to 600 dpi, head alignment settings\n    stored in the printer are not made use of, so use a one-cartridge\n    (CMY) printing mode in case of mis-alignments.<p>\n\n    For basic printing functionality use the <a href=\"\n    http://hplipopensource.com/\">HPIJS driver </a>. \n    For advanced functionality such as printer status, maintenance \n    features, and photo card unload use the <a href=\"\n    http://hplipopensource.com/\">HPLIP driver</a> \n    (which includes HPIJS). <p>\n    \n    Copying works fine from the front panel.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: 1 colour (CMY) cartridge and 1 black (K) cartridge<p>"
