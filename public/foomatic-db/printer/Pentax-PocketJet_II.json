            "en": "Ultra-portable printer which weighs around one pound (494g) with\n    battery. Its size is only 10.4in x 1.18in x 2.17in (255mm x 30mm x\n    55mm). The printer is a direct thermal printer and so it needs\n    special thermal paper. Pentax provides so-called \"Pentax\n    Quality Paper\" which is much thicker and not so glossy as fax\n    rolls, so one can probably use this printer even for\n    correspondence. Due to the thermal printing the only moving part\n    in it is the mechanics to advance the paper. this seems to be one\n    important fact to get it so small.<p>\n\n    The printer is not only intended to be used with notebook\n    computers, but also with handhelds and PDAs. It has a parallel\n    port built-in and one gets USB, IR, and serial adapters as option,\n    and drivers for handhelds and PDAs are available.<p>\n\n    This 300-dpi model is made more for notebooks, there is also the\n    PocketJet 200 with 200 dpi which is more suitable for\n    PDAs.<p>\n\n    This printer is light, but not a \"Paperweight\". Rildo\n    Pragana, the author of the \"ml85p\" driver (for the\n    Samsung ML-85P laser winprinter), made a free software driver for\n    this printer in cooperation with Pentax. So this you can really\n    use this printer with your portable computer running a free\n    operating system.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Special \"Pentax Quality\" thermal paper, $8.49/100 sheet\n\tLetter. No ink or ribbons needed.<p>"
