For advanced functionality such\n    as printer status and maintenance features, use the\n    <a href=\"http://hplipopensource.com/\">\n    HPLIP driver</a> (which includes HPIJS). <p>\n    \n    Works with uniprint driver cdj550.upp, too.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: two cartridges, include printhead<p>"
